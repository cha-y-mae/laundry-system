## Time-Sharing Laundry System

This program was build for my Object Oriented Programming class and demonstrates the use of diffreent OOP paradigms learned throughout the course. 

## Introduction to the problem to solve 

The Time-Sharing laundry system is a system that helps optimize the use of laundry machines while accounting for the constraints of time and resources. In this project, I aim to design a product that optimizes the use of a set of 5 machines only and a large number of students with tight schedules. Each user will be assigned a machine in a way that would minimize their waiting time.

## Approach 

To solve the problem, I create a system that takes user information and starting time and either starts a cycle or reports a problem depending on the user choice in the menu.
